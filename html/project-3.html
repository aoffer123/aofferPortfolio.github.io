                    <p class="small-label-text">Habits significantly impact our lives, influencing our thoughts, feelings, and actions. While cultivating good habits can lead to success and personal growth, eliminating bad habits remains challenging due to their immediate reinforcement. Most existing habit tracking apps focus on completion and data visualization but lack mechanisms to help users break bad habits and form good ones consistently.</p>

                <div class="d-flex flex-column">
                <p class="label-text">Our Solution: </p>
                    <p class="small-label-text">New Leaf addresses the issue of habit formation by encouraging users to replace bad habits with good ones through personalized reinforcement. The app allows users to create habits, categorize them, set short-term and long-term goals, and define rewards for achieving these goals. By providing notifications and progress tracking, New Leaf ensures users are consistently motivated to maintain their good habits.</p>

                                <p class="small-label-text">Our approach centers on user-centric design, starting with a homepage that lists all tracked habits. When creating a new habit, users enter a title, description, category, and both short-term and long-term goals, along with corresponding rewards. This structure sets New Leaf apart from other habit-tracking apps by emphasizing goal setting and rewards. Notifications alert users when they achieve their goals, prompting them to set new ones, and a detailed habit view allows users to track their progress and reward eligibility.</p></li>

These prototypes included detailed visual design elements, interactions, and animations to closely mimic the final product. My focus was on ensuring the design was visually appealing and user-friendly. The prototypes were created using Figma, which allowed for precise control over the design elements and seamless collaboration with the development team.</p></li>
                                <p class="small-label-text">In addition to visual elements, I incorporated interactive components to simulate user interactions and workflows. This allowed for thorough testing and validation of the user experience before moving into the development phase. The high-fidelity prototypes were presented to stakeholders for feedback and approval, ensuring that all design aspects met user needs and expectations. This process was crucial for identifying any potential issues early and making necessary adjustments to create a seamless and intuitive final product.</p></li>

Utilizing React JS and the MUI component library, I implemented a responsive and interactive user interface. This involved creating reusable components, managing state with React's hooks, and ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes. My focus was on maintaining clean, modular code and adhering to best practices in front-end development.</p></li>
                                <p class="small-label-text">In addition to front-end implementation, I also set up the Firebase database to facilitate integration with the application. This included configuring Firebase Authentication for user management and Firestore for real-time data storage. My role involved writing the necessary backend code to connect the React components to the Firebase services, ensuring secure and efficient data handling. This setup allowed for real-time updates and a smooth user experience, critical for the functionality of our meal planner and diet tracker.</p></li>
