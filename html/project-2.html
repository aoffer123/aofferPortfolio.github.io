                <p class="pt-4">I was brought in as an intern to redesign the website for Irdeto Keystone Fleet, a wireless key solution for managing vehicle fleets. The existing website handled a variety of tasks including user management, vehicle assignments, and other fleet-related activities. My primary goal was to modernize the interface and improve the overall user experience. </p>
                <p>I began the project by developing initial prototypes, focusing on creating a more intuitive and user-friendly interface. The design process was highly iterative, involving multiple rounds of feedback and revisions with stakeholders. Each iteration aimed to refine the functionality and visual appeal of the website, ensuring it met the needs of end-users effectively. </p>
                <p>Throughout the redesign process, I worked closely with stakeholders to understand their requirements and incorporate their feedback into the prototypes. This collaborative approach was essential for aligning the design with the business objectives and user needs. By leveraging modern design principles and best practices, I aimed to create a seamless user experience that facilitated efficient fleet management. </p>
                <p>After finalizing the designs, I implemented several of the prototypes into the actual website interface using React JS and the PrimeReact component library. This involved translating the visual and interactive elements from the prototypes into code, ensuring the designs were accurately represented in the final product. The implementation phase also required close collaboration with the development team to integrate the new interface with the existing backend systems. </p>
                <p>The result was a modernized, user-friendly application that significantly improved the user experience. The new design not only enhanced the visual appeal of the website but also streamlined the workflow for managing users, vehicle assignments, and other key tasks. This project demonstrated the importance of user-centered design and the value of continuous iteration, stakeholder engagement, and effective implementation in developing successful digital solutions. </p>
